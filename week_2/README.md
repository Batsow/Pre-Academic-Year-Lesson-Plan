This week, I learned conditional statements, mainly called the if statement, elif statement and the else statement.
They mostly evaluate wether a certain condition is True or False after using comparison operators
The if statements can be nested within each other to handle more decision making instances 
you can use the "not" operator on an if statement (i.e if not x.isalpha() ) and the not operator is part part of the logical operators which are the "and" & "or"
The match statement which is similar to the if,elif and else statements is also a comditional statement
in the match statement, when you are evaluating case by case, you can use the '_' an underscore in the last case which will match with any input, resulting in a similar behaviour as an else statement
